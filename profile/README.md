METATOOL (A metapredictive model of synthetic awareness for enabling tool invention) is a project funded under The European Innovation Council (EIC) that aims to provide a computational model of synthetic awareness to enhance adaptation and achieve tool invention. This will enable a robot to monitor and self-evaluate its performance, ground and reuse this information for adapting to new circumstances, and finally unlock the possibility of creating new tools. 

Under the predictive account of awareness, and based on both neuroscientific and archeological evidence, we will: 
1) develop a novel computational model of metacognition based on predictive processing (metaprediction) and
2) validate its utility in real robots in two use case scenarios: conditional sequential tasks and tool creation.

## Objectives
This project addresses synthetic awareness as a metacognitive process built over the predictive brain hypothesis. The main focus is the development of a computational model that enables an artificial agent to go from tool use to tool invention. 

To achieve the general aim of the project, three specific objectives should be accomplished:
1) study the consistency of metacognitive capabilities and awareness as a facilitator for the emergence of tool making
2) develop a computational model of synthetic awareness based on metacognition and the predictive processing account of perception and action to unlock the mechanisms of tool invention.
3) validate our synthetic awareness technology on embodied artificial agents.
